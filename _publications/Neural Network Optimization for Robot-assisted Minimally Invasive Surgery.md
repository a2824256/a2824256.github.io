This paper proposes a neural network (NN) based
hierarchical control of a 7-DoF robot manipulator for RobotAssisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RAMIS), which at the
same time guarantees task tracking, manipulability index,
Remote Center of Motion (RCM). A theoretically grounded hierarchical control law based on neural network is introduced to
control multiple constraints based on their priority. Finally, the
effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated
with experimental results. The results show that the proposed
NN-based method can optimal multi-constraints at the same
time and have good performance.
