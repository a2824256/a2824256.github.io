The complexity of surgical operation can be released significantly if surgical robots can learn the manipulation
skills by imitation from complex tasks demonstrations such as
suturing, puncture, and knotting, etc.. This paper proposes a
Kernelized Movement Primitives (KMP) based manipulation
skill transferring technique for robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery from human demonstrations. This approach
facilitates the learning and trial phase performed offline, which
reduces the risks and cost for the practical surgical operation.
Finally, it is demonstrated by transferring manipulation skills
for reaching and puncturing.
